# Earthquake Dataset Reader

This Java program is a small tool to read earthquake data from the US Geosciences or the New Zealand GeoNet servers and create a compact .CSV file.

The .CSV file has a header with the total amount of data lines at the end, and the first two data lines are the minimum and maximum values of each data column.
